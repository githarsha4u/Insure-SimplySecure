                    <li><strong>Referrals Needed</strong>: To see specialists, members need a referral from their PCP.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Typically lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs, promoting preventive care.</li>

                <summary>What is a premium in health insurance?</summary>
                <p>A premium is the amount you pay for your health insurance every month. Even if you don't use medical services, you must pay your premium to keep your coverage active.</p>

                <summary>What is a deductible?</summary>
                <p>A deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket for covered healthcare services before your insurance plan starts to pay. For example, if your deductible is $1,000, you'll pay 100% of eligible healthcare expenses until the total amount spent reaches $1,000. After that, your insurance starts to pay.</p>

                <summary>What is the difference between in-network and out-of-network providers?</summary>
                <p>In-network providers have contracted with your insurance company to provide services at a negotiated rate. Out-of-network providers have not agreed to the negotiated rate, and using them will generally result in higher out-of-pocket costs.</p>

                <summary>What does out-of-pocket maximum mean?</summary>
                <p>The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you'll have to pay for covered healthcare services in a policy period (typically one year). After you spend this amount on deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance, your health plan pays 100% of the costs of covered benefits.</p>

                <summary>Can I change my health insurance plan outside of open enrollment?</summary>
                <p>Typically, you can only change your health insurance plan during the open enrollment period. However, you may qualify for a special enrollment period if you experience certain life events, such as getting married, having a baby, or losing other health coverage.</p>
